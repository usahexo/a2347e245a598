#  NBA Players Shine in Gran Canaria Game

The Gran Canaria game is always a much-anticipated event on the NBA calendar, as it features some of the league's brightest stars shining in an exhibition match. This year was no exception, with LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant all making appearances.

James started things off for the United States team by scoring the first nine points of the game. He was dominant down low and showed why he is considered one of the best players in the world.

Curry also had a strong performance, shooting 3-pointers with ease and demonstrating his trademark ball handling skills. He finished with 22 points, four rebounds, and four assists.

Durant was equally impressive, scoring 33 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. He was especially effective in the fourth quarter, when he led a comeback that nearly gave Team USA the victory.

In the end, however, Spain managed to prevail 102-96. Pau Gasol led all scorers with 34 points, while Marc Gasol chipped in with 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Spanish team looked very impressive against one of the best lineups in the NBA, and they will be one of the favorites to win gold at next year's Olympics.
