#  How to get rid of the slot machine from cuphead Orwell – for good!

Cuphead is a great game. The graphics are amazing, the controls are perfect, and overall it is just a blast to play. However, there is one part of the game that I absolutely hate: the slot machine.

The slot machine is a minigame that you can play at any time in the game. It costs you one coin to play, and you have three tries to get as many matches as possible. If you get at least one match, you win back your coin plus another one. If you don’t get any matches, you lose your coin.

This minigame is infuriating because it is completely random. You could play it fifty times in a row and never get a match, or you could get a match on your very first try. There is no strategy that you can use to improve your chances of winning; it all comes down to luck.

This minigame takes away from the otherwise excellent Cuphead experience. Thankfully, there is an easy way to remove it from the game entirely: by deleting a single file.

To delete the slot machine from Cuphead, follow these steps:

1) Open up File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).
2) Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cuphead\DATA . This folder contains all of the files that make up Cuphead.
3) Delete the file named SLOTMACHINE_INIT .
4) Restart Cuphead, and the slot machine will be gone!
