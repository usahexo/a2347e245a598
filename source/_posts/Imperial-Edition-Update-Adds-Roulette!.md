#  FFXIV's Latest Update Includes A Fun New Roulette Game 

Since the game's inception in 2010, Final Fantasy XIV has undergone many changes. Updates are released every few months, and each one has something new to offer players. The game's most recent update is called "The Far Edge of Fate," and it includes a particularly fun new addition: a roulette game.

This new game is accessed by talking to Gilda Star located in Idyllshire (X:6 Y:5). She will provide you with a roulette wheel that you can use to play the game. The object of the game is to match two of the same numbers on the wheel in order to win prizes. There are six different prizes available, and they range in value from 100 Gil to 1,000 Gil.

So how do you play? It's actually quite simple. You just spin the wheel and let it stop on one of the numbers. If both of the numbers match, you win the prize associated with that number. If they don't match, you lose your bet. You can play as many times as you want per day, and there is no limit on how much money you can win.

The roulette game is a fun addition to Final Fantasy XIV that adds a bit of excitement to the game. It's easy to learn how to play, and it's a great way to earn some extra money. So be sure to give it a try next time you're in Idyllshire!
