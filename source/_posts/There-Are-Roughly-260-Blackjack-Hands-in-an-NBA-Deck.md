#  There Are Roughly 260 Blackjack Hands in an NBA Deck

In professional basketball, there are only 260 unique blackjack hands possible. This is because there are 16 players on the court at any given time, each of whom can hold up to five cards.

To figure out how many blackjack hands are in an NBA deck, we first need to determine the probability of each specific hand. There are 10 possible pairs (2 through 10), six possible suited hands (Ace through 6), and four possible unsuited hands (7 through Ace). This gives us a total of 26 different combinations.

Since each player can hold up to five cards, this means that there are 16 different ways to get a specific hand. For example, the probability of getting a pair of kings is 1/10, while the probability of getting two queens is 1/6.

Now that we know the probabilities of each hand, we can calculate the total number of blackjack hands in an NBA deck. This is just 26 multiplied by 16, or 416 hands.

Interestingly enough, there are only four unique blackjack hands in an NBA deck—Aces full of kings, three of a kind, two pair, and one pair. The vast majority of hands (392) are either two different pairs or a mix of different card types.

#  You'll Get Many Chances to Win with These Many Blackjack Hands in an NBA Deck

It has been a few years since the NBA had to hand over their draft picks to the Philadelphia 76ers. In those three years, the Sixers have not had a top pick. The Los Angeles Lakers, who had the number one overall pick in 2017 and 2019, now have to give their 2020 pick to the Sixers.

The Lakers handed their number four overall pick in 2021 to the Cleveland Cavaliers as part of the trade package for Anthony Davis. That gave the Cavs three first round draft picks over the next two years. The Brooklyn Nets, who had the number six overall pick in 2020, traded their 2021 first round pick to the Golden State Warriors as part of the sign-and-trade for Kevin Durant.

The Boston Celtics also traded away their 2021 first round pick as part of the deal for Kyrie Irving. As a result, there are only four teams that will have a first round pick in 2021: Philadelphia, LA Clippers, Miami Heat, and Oklahoma City Thunder.

The Miami Heat acquired their first round pick from the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington. The Oklahoma City Thunder obtained theirs from the Houston Rockets as part of the Chris Paul trade.

The Clippers got theirs from Michael Jordan and the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Tobias Harris and Boban Marjanovic. The Sixers will get their pick from either the Lakers or Celtics depending on which team finishes with a worse record this season.

With so many teams having given away their future draft picks, it is important for them to make sure they win now. Many of these teams still have a chance to make it to the playoffs this season. The Lakers are currently in 10th place in the Western Conference, but they are only three games out of fifth place.

The Celtics are in second place in the Eastern Conference, but they are only two games ahead ofthe Miami Heat who are in seventh place. The Oklahoma City Thunder are currently in sixth place in the Western Conference, but they are only two games ahead ofthe Utah Jazz who are in 11th place.

If any of these teams want to make a run at winning an NBA championship this season, they will need to play better basketball than they have been playing recently.

#  An NBA Deck Holds More Than Enough Blackjack Hands for You to Ruin a Casino

The National Basketball Association, or NBA as it is more commonly known, is a professional basketball league in North America composed of thirty teams: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.

The league was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league adopted its current name at the start of the 1949-50 season.

The NBA regular season begins in October and ends in April. Teams play 82 games apiece. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams compete in a best-of-seven series to determine the champion. 

The popularity of blackjack and other casino games can be traced back to their roots on docks and riverboats where men gathered to play cards between voyages. Gambling grew throughout the country as land-based casinos opened up shop, but it reached new heights with the introduction of online gambling sites towards the turn of the century. Casinos have always been a popular destination for people looking to take a break from reality and enjoy some fun and excitement, but what if you could visit one without putting your hard earned money at risk?

Thanks to modern technology, you can! All you need is an internet connection and an NBA deck of cards. That’s right – each team in the NBA has been assigned its own card, allowing you to play blackjack (or any other casino game) against real life opponents from the comfort of your own home.

But don’t just take my word for it – give it a try for yourself! Here’s how:

1) Download an NBA deck of cards from one of the many online retailers that stock them. You can find a wide variety of decks, including licensed products from all 30 teams, as well as unlicensed decks that are cheaper if you don’t mind sacrificing some authenticity. 
2) Cut out each team’s card and lay them out in front of you according to their assigned order in the league (e.g. Golden State Warriors at Position 1, Toronto Raptors at Position 2 etc.). 
3) Flip over two cards to begin your game. The player with the highest total value (sum of both cards) takes control of both cards and becomes dealer for that round. Suit is irrelevant for this game mode*.  
4) Play blackjack as usual, taking turns as dealer until either both players have busted or there are no more cards left in the deck. 
5) If you lose all your money playing this way, don’t worry – casinos won’t let you go broke that easily! In fact, even if you were to somehow manage to lose all your funds playing this way, you could always reload your account and continue playing without having to put any more money at risk. So there’s really nothing to lose by giving this fun new way to experience blackjack a try!

#  With This Many Blackjack Hands, You're Bound to Hit 21 at Least Once!

In any given blackjack game, the odds of getting exactly 21 with your first two cards are about 1 in 3.5. However, by playing enough hands, you’re bound to get 21 at least once. In fact, with a sufficiently large sample size, you can be almost guaranteed to get 21 at least once.

To see this, let’s consider a game in which we have 10000 hands to play. In this game, we always hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. We’ll also assume that the dealer stands on 17. In this case, the average number of hands it takes to get 21 is 6752. So, if we play 10000 hands, we can expect to get 21 at least once.

Of course, in reality things won’t always go as planned. Sometimes we might get extremely lucky and get 21 on our very first hand. Other times, we might have to play through all 10000 hands without ever getting 21. But on average, by playing enough hands we are guaranteed to get 21 at least once.
