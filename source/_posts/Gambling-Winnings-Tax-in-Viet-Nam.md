#  Gambling Winnings Tax in Viet Nam

The Vietnamese government introduced a new income tax policy in January 2018 that affects gambling winnings. The new policy levies a 10% income tax on gambling winnings, which is in addition to the existing individual income tax rate of 5-35%.

This change has had a significant impact on the Vietnamese gambling industry. Many casinos and betting operators have stopped accepting bets from Vietnamese customers, and those that continue to do so are imposing higher taxes on winning bets.

The impact of the new policy is also being felt by Vietnamese gamblers. Many are now opting to gamble abroad, where they can enjoy better odds and avoid paying the additional 10% tax.

There are tax implications when it comes to gambling in Viet Nam. How much you can claim as a loss and what records you need to keep differs depending on your status in the country. This article will provide an overview of the different rules for Vietnamese citizens, foreigners living in Vietnam and foreigners who are just visiting.

#  Gambling Losses in Viet Nam


Gambling losses in Viet Nam are causing concern for the government as locals bet increasing amounts of money on local and international lotteries. In 2016, the total amount gambled was estimated at VND9 trillion (US$396 million) and is predicted to grow by 10% each year. Gambling is illegal in Viet Nam, except for a state-run lottery, so most betting takes place offline in informal settings such as street stalls, coffee shops, and homes.

The main concern for the government is that much of this gambling is done by poor people who can least afford to lose their money. In addition to the social cost of people who are addicted to gambling, there is also a financial cost as the government loses out on tax revenue. There have been calls to legalize some forms of gambling in order to better regulate it and collect taxes, but these have been met with resistance from religious groups.

There are also concerns about illegal gambling operations which are run by organized crime syndicates. These operations often use pirated software to avoid detection, and they often target vulnerable people such as those who have recently lost their jobs or are in debt. The police have stepped up efforts to crack down on these operations, but they are difficult to shut down completely.

Despite the risks, gambling remains popular in Viet Nam due to the high potential returns. With interest rates low and poverty high, many people see gambling as a way to make quick money. This has led to an increase in problem gambling, with estimates that around 2% of the population suffers from addiction. The government has been trying to raise awareness about the dangers of gambling, but it is likely going to take more than just education campaigns to address this issue.

#  Tax on Gambling Winnings and Losses in Viet Nam

In Viet Nam, gambling is a popular pastime, with millions of people indulging in games such as bingo, lotteries, and casinos. However, because it is seen as a form of entertainment and not a necessary part of life, gambling is not generally considered a taxable activity.

This has started to change in recent years as the government has begun to levy taxes on gambling winnings and losses. The aim of this tax is to help offset the social and economic costs that gambling can have on society.

Income from gambling is considered taxable under Vietnamese law if it is generated in the country or if the gambler is a resident of Viet Nam. Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, casinos, betting, and other games of chance. Income from sweepstakes and promotional games is also subject to tax.

Losses from gambling are also taxable, but only if they are related to activities that took place in Viet Nam or if the gambler is a resident of Viet Nam. In other words, losses incurred while gambling online or through foreign casinos are not taxable.

The tax rate for gambling income varies depending on the amount of income earned. For example, income up to VND 300 million (around US$13,000) is taxed at 10%, while income above VND 3 billion (around US$130,000) is taxed at 20%. There is no tax on losses from gambling.

Gambling remains a popular pastime in Viet Nam despite the imposition of taxes on winnings and losses. This may be because the tax rates are not particularly high, especially when compared to other forms of taxation such as income tax or value-added tax (VAT).
