#  Casino exec: Sports betting will pump $100B into economy

The CEO of a major casino corporation said Wednesday that legalized sports betting will pump $100 billion into the economy over the next 10 years.

"This is a watershed moment for our country and for the gambling industry," said Steve Wynn, CEO of Wynn Resorts. "There is enormous potential for this market."

Wynn made his remarks to a panel of policymakers at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. He was joined by other gaming executives, who also support legalizing sports betting.

Their argument is that legalizing sports betting will create jobs, generate tax revenue and help revive economically depressed areas. They also contend that it will help deter illegal gambling operations.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to more problem gambling and organized crime. But Charles Robinson, a senior policy adviser at the American Gaming Association, said those concerns can be addressed through regulation.

"We are not advocating an expansion of gambling," Robinson said. "We are advocating an expansion of choice."

Some lawmakers appear to be open to the idea. Last month, Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) introduced legislation that would legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks across the country. The bill would leave it up to states to decide whether to allow online betting as well.

"I am confident that this legislation will usher in a new era for the gaming industry, creating thousands of jobs and generating billions of dollars in economic activity," Hatch said in a statement.

#  3 numbers that could make you a winner at sports betting

When it comes to sports betting, there are some people that seem to have a knack for it, while others not so much. However, with a little bit of research and the right information, anyone can start winning bets. Here are three numbers that could help get you started.

The first number is 2.6. This is the percentage of games that experts say you should bet on in order to break even. So, if you are only betting on half of the games, you are automatically decreasing your chances of winning. The second number is 52.7. This is the percentage of bets that should be placed on home teams in order to make a profit. The reason for this is that home teams tend to win more often than away teams. Finally, the third number is 94. This is the percentage of money that should be wagered on favourites in order to make a profit in the long run.

#  What the mystery sports betting number means for you

The mystery sports betting number is the new thing on the betting block. What does it mean for you and your bets?

When you see this number, it means that the sports book has determined that there is an unusual amount of money wagered on one side of the game. So what does this mean for you as a bettor?

If you are thinking about betting on the game, then you should definitely consider betting against the mystery number. The reason for this is simple - the sports book has already determined that there is an abnormal amount of money being wagered on one side, so they have already factored this information into their odds. This means that if you bet against the mystery number, you are essentially getting better odds than if you had just bet with the crowd.

On the other hand, if you already have a bet placed on the game and it is not against the mystery number, then you may want to reconsider your position. The reason for this is that if too many people bet against the mystery number, then its original effect will be negated and the sports book will simply adjust their odds accordingly. This means that if too many people bet against the mystery number, then your original wager could actually lose value.

So what should you do? If you are undecided about a particular game, then it might be a good idea to wait until after the mystery number is released to make your final decision. That way, you can get a better sense of where public opinion lies and make a more informed decision about your wager.

#  How to beat the casino and win at sports betting

Gambling has always been a popular pastime, and with the advent of online casinos and sports betting, it has only become more widespread. While for some gambling is a fun way to spend an evening or pass the time, for others it can be a serious addiction. If you are someone who wants to gamble but doesn't want to lose money, this article is for you. In this article, we will explore some techniques that can be used to beat the casino and win at sports betting.

The first thing to realize is that casinos and bookmakers are in the business of making money. They are not charitable organizations; they are there to make a profit. This means that they have built in odds that ensure that over the long term they will make money regardless of how individual gamblers fare. This means that if you want to beat the casino or bookmaker, you need to find ways to overcome these odds.

One way to do this is by using effective strategies when gambling. For example, if you are playing blackjack, it is important to learn basic strategy so that you can make the best possible decisions each time you play. Similarly, if you are betting on sports, it is important to do your research so that you have a good understanding of the teams and players involved.

Another thing to keep in mind is that casinos and bookmakers use mathematics and physics to their advantage. This means that you need to understand these concepts in order to beat them. For example, in Roulette there is a higher probability of certain numbers being hit because they are selected less often. By understanding basic mathematics and physics, you can use this information to your advantage when betting.

Finally, it is important to remember that luck also plays a role in gambling. There is no guaranteed way to win every time, so don't get discouraged if you have a run of bad luck. Instead, just accept it as part of the game and move on. If you stick to these tips, you should be able to improve your chances of beating the casino or bookmaker and winning more often than not

#  Sports betting 101: The basics of making a winning wager

It’s no secret that sports betting can be a lucrative endeavor. But despite the allure, many bettors never really learn how to make money betting on sports. If you’re one of those people, or if you want to become a better sports bettor, this guide is for you.

In this article, we will cover the basics of sports betting. We will teach you how to read odds, place bets, and manage your bankroll. So whether you’re just getting started or you’re looking to improve your betting skills, keep reading.

# How to read odds

Odds are simply a way to compare two teams or outcomes and determine who is the favorite and who is the underdog. The favorite is always listed with a negative number (e.g., -200), while the underdog is always listed with a positive number (e.g., +100).

Here’s an example: let’s say the Golden State Warriors are playing the Sacramento Kings. The Warriors are favored by -7.5 points, which means that they are expected to beat the Kings by 7.5 points or more. If you want to bet on the Warriors, you would have to wager $200 to win $100. On the other hand, if you want to bet on the Kings, you would only need to wager $100 to win $110 (because they are considered underdogs).

# Placing bets

Now that you know how to read odds, it’s time to start placing bets. There are two types of bets that you can place: straight bets and parlays. A straight bet is simply a wager on one team or outcome, while a parlay is a wager on two or more teams or outcomes.

Here’s an example of a parlay: let’s say you want to bet on the Warriors and Colts in Sunday’s games. You would put $10 on each team for a total wager of $20. If both teams win, you would pocket $240 (your original stake plus your winnings). However, if even just one of your teams loses, your entire wager would be lost.

Now that we have covered the basics of sports betting, let’s take a look at some tips for increasing your chances of winning.
