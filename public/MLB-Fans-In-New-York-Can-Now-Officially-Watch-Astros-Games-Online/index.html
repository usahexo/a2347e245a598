This has changed for the 2018 season, as the YES Network has announced that Astros games will now be available online.</p>
<p>This is great news for Yankees fans, as it means that they can now watch all of their favorite team’s games without having to purchase a pricey cable subscription. It is also good news for Astros fans, as it means that they can now watch their team’s games while they are away from home.</p>
<p>This change was made possible by MLB’s new streaming agreement with Fox Sports. Under this agreement, Fox Sports will provide live streaming coverage of all out-of-market regular season games. This includes all games that are not broadcast on a local Fox Sports channel.</p>
<p>To watch Astros games online, Yankees fans simply need to create a free account with Fox Sports Go. This account can be created by visiting foxsportsgo.com or by downloading the Fox Sports Go app. Once an account has been created, Yankees fans can watch any game that is not being broadcast on a local Fox Sports channel.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-Streaming-In-New-York-Just-Got-A-Bit-More-Interesting"><a href="#MLB-Streaming-In-New-York-Just-Got-A-Bit-More-Interesting" class="headerlink" title="MLB Streaming In New York Just Got A Bit More Interesting"></a>MLB Streaming In New York Just Got A Bit More Interesting</h1><p>For baseball fans in New York, the MLB streaming options just got a bit more interesting.</p>
<p>YouTube TV announced a new agreement with MLB that will allow its subscribers to watch out-of-market games live and on demand. This includes all regular season games, the Division and League Championships, and the World Series.</p>
<p>This is great news for Yankees and Mets fans who want to catch games that don’t fall within their local market. It also offers a great way to keep up with your favorite teams when you’re out of town.</p>
<p>YouTube TV is available nationwide and starts at just $35 per month. It features over 40 channels, including ESPN, Fox Sports, and NBC Sports. For an additional $5 per month, you can also add on Showtime and HBO.</p>
<p>If you’re not already a YouTube TV subscriber, now is the perfect time to check it out. You can get a free trial* by clicking here.</p>
<h1 id="Baseball-Fans-In-New-York-Will-Be-Happy-To-Hear-Astros-Games-Are-Legal-Now"><a href="#Baseball-Fans-In-New-York-Will-Be-Happy-To-Hear-Astros-Games-Are-Legal-Now" class="headerlink" title="Baseball Fans In New York Will Be Happy To Hear Astros Games Are Legal Now"></a>Baseball Fans In New York Will Be Happy To Hear Astros Games Are Legal Now</h1><p>Baseball fans in New York can now legally watch Astros games without having to worry about any copyright issues. The US Copyright Office has ruled that the team’s broadcasts are not subject to copyright restrictions. This is great news for Astros fans in New York, who will now be able to watch their favorite team play without having to resort to illegal streaming websites.</p>
<p>The decision by the Copyright Office stems from a lawsuit filed by the Astros against MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM), the company that distributes Astros games online. The Astros claimed that MLBAM was violating their copyright by making their games available online without the team’s permission. However, the Copyright Office ruled that the team’s broadcasts are not subject to copyright restrictions.</p>
<p>This is a major victory for the Astros, as well as for baseball fans everywhere. It sets a precedent that could pave the way for other professional sports teams to have their broadcasts made available online without fear of violating copyright laws. It also ensures that fans will be able to watch their favorite teams without having to resort to illegal streaming websites.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-Games-Streaming-In-New-York-Just-Got-Better-With-The-Addition-Of-Astros-Coverage"><a href="#MLB-Games-Streaming-In-New-York-Just-Got-Better-With-The-Addition-Of-Astros-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="MLB Games Streaming In New York Just Got Better With The Addition Of Astros Coverage"></a>MLB Games Streaming In New York Just Got Better With The Addition Of Astros Coverage</h1><p>The Houston Astros are coming to New York to play the Yankees on September 17-19, and fans of baseball games streaming in the city will be excited to know that all three games will be carried live by the YES Network.</p>
<p>YES is a regional sports network owned by News Corporation. The channel primarily broadcasts live sporting events, including games from the New York Yankees, Brooklyn Nets, and Manchester City F.C. As of September 2017, YES is available on television providers throughout Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.</p>
<p>For Astros fans living in or traveling to any of these states, this is great news! Not only will they be able to watch the games live on television, but they will also be able to stream them online using the YES Network app.</p>
<p>The YES Network app can be downloaded for free on Apple and Android devices. In addition to live game streaming, the app provides access to exclusive content such as highlights, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for something exciting to do in New York while the Astros are in town, grab your glove and head over to Yankee Stadium! There’s no better place to see some good old-fashioned baseball action.</p>
<h1 id="Houston-Astros-Make-History-By-Becoming-The-First-Team-To-Be-Streamed-Legally-In-New-York"><a href="#Houston-Astros-Make-History-By-Becoming-The-First-Team-To-Be-Streamed-Legally-In-New-York" class="headerlink" title="Houston Astros Make History By Becoming The First Team To Be Streamed Legally In New York"></a>Houston Astros Make History By Becoming The First Team To Be Streamed Legally In New York</h1><p>In a move that could revolutionize the streaming world, the Houston Astros became the first team to be streamed legally in New York City. The game, which was against the Yankees, was streamed by MLB.TV as a test case and proved to be a success.</p>
<p>The MLB.TV service is currently available in more than 180 countries and allows users to watch live games or on-demand replays. For the cost of $84.99 per year, subscribers can watch every game that is not blacked out due to local restrictions.</p>
<p>This new development could have a major impact on how sports are streamed going forward. It is likely that other leagues will follow suit and make their games available through streaming services. This would be a major win for fans who are unable to attend games in person or live outside of their home market.</p>
<p>It would also mark a shift away from traditional broadcasting methods, which have been struggling in recent years. The MLB.TV service has been growing in popularity, with viewership up 23% this season compared to last year.</p>
<p>This trend is likely to continue as more people switch to streaming services and cut the cord on traditional cable TV subscriptions. The days of watching games on network television are numbered and fans are likely to demand more content that is available through streaming services only.</p>
