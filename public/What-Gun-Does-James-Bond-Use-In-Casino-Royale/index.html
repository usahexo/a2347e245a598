The reason why this particular gun was chosen for the movie is because it has low recoil and is very accurate.</p>

<h1 id="James-Bond’s-Gun-In-Casino-Royale"><a href="#James-Bond’s-Gun-In-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="James Bond’s Gun In Casino Royale"></a>James Bond’s Gun In Casino Royale</h1><p>When Casino Royale was released in 2006, it introduced a new James Bond to the big screen. This Bond was played by Daniel Craig and he brought a new level of toughness and realism to the role. In one particular scene, Craig’s Bond uses his gun to kill three people in close quarters.</p>
<p>In the theatrical version of Casino Royale, this scene took place in an elevator. However, in later versions of the movie – including the DVD release – it was moved to a different location due to concerns that audiences might be disturbed by so much violence taking place in such a confined space.</p>
<p>The gun used by Craig in this scene is a Walther PPK&#x2F;S with a four-inch barrel. This weapon is also used by Bonds played by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. The PPK&#x2F;S is a shortened version of the original PPK handgun, which was introduced in 1931.</p>
<p>The PPK&#x2F;S has been used by James Bond in six different movies: Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), The Man With the Golden Gun (1974) and Licence to Kill (1989). It was last used by Daniel Craig in 2012’s Skyfall.</p>

Bond eventually defeats Le Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game, and recovers the money he lost to Le Chiffre in the process.</p>
<p>One of the most iconic elements of Casino Royale is James Bond’s gun. What type of gun does James Bond use in Casino Royale?</p>
<p>In the novel, Fleming describes Bond’s weapon as being a “Walther PPK automatic pistol.” This weapon would go on to become the signature firearm of James Bond throughout the rest of the franchise. In many ways, it has become as iconic as Bonds himself.</p>
<p>The Walther PPK has been used by 007 since Dr. No in 1962, and aside from a few modifications it has remained relatively unchanged. The main appeal of the PPK for 007 is its size; it is small and easily concealable, which is perfect for someone like James Bond who often finds himself in tight situations.</p>
<p>Today, there are several different versions of the Walther PPK available for purchase. There is even an airsoft version that can be purchased for shooting practice. If you’re interested in purchasing your own Walther PPK, be sure to do your research and find one that fits your needs.</p>
