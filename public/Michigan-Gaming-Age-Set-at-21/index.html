        <h1 id="Michigan-Gaming-Age-Set-at-21"><a href="#Michigan-Gaming-Age-Set-at-21" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Gaming Age Set at 21"></a>Michigan Gaming Age Set at 21</h1><p>Michigan Governor’s office has released a statement on the state’s gaming age, which will be set at 21. In a tweet, the office said that “adults of 21 years or older will be able to enjoy Michigan’s exciting new casinos.” The decision comes as the state moves to launch three new casinos in Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Lansing.</p>
<p>When asked about the decision, Deputy Press Secretary Tiffany Brown said that “the governor believes that adults of legal gambling age should have access to these venues.” She added that the governor is committed to making sure that the gambling industry is safe and responsible for Michiganders.</p>
<p>The gaming age has been a point of contention in Michigan for some time. Some lawmakers had pushed for an age of 18, while others wanted it set at 21. The final decision falls in line with most other states in the country.</p>
<p>Michigan’s new casinos are expected to create thousands of jobs and bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue each year.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Raises-Gaming-Age-to-21"><a href="#Michigan-Raises-Gaming-Age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Raises Gaming Age to 21"></a>Michigan Raises Gaming Age to 21</h1><p>Michigan is increasing its gaming age from 18 to 21, in an effort to curtail gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The new law, which goes into effect in October, applies to casinos, horse tracks, and online gambling sites. Michigan joins a growing number of states that have raised the gaming age in recent years.</p>
<p>Many experts believe that the rising gaming age will help reduce problem gambling rates. “There’s a fair amount of evidence that if you raise the age limit, it will have an impact on Problem Gambling rates because most people start gambling when they’re young,” said Dr. John Warren Kindt, a professor of business and legal policy at the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>Others argue that the new law will simply push problem gamblers underground, where they will be more likely to engage in illegal activity. “It’s going to force these people into unregulated and unsafe gambling environments where they’re going to lose even more money and be at risk for other types of harm,” said Cheryl Ann Wilson, executive director of the Michigan Council on Problem Gambling.</p>
<p>So far there has been no definitive study on the impact of raising the gaming age. However, most experts agree that any step that can be taken to reduce problem gambling is a good one.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-becomes-the-Latest-State-to-Raise-the-Gaming-Age-to-21"><a href="#Michigan-becomes-the-Latest-State-to-Raise-the-Gaming-Age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Michigan becomes the Latest State to Raise the Gaming Age to 21"></a>Michigan becomes the Latest State to Raise the Gaming Age to 21</h1><p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer today announced that the state will be raising the minimum age to legally gamble from 18 to 21. The decision comes as part of a larger effort by the Governor and her administration to combat problem gambling in Michigan.</p>
<p>“Protecting our residents is a top priority for my administration,” said Governor Whitmer. “This change will help keep our young people safe while they are enjoying all that our great state has to offer.”</p>
<p>The decision has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the move as overdue while others argue that it will only push problem gamblers deeper into hiding. Representative Brandt Iden, who chairs the House Regulatory Reform Committee, released a statement saying that he supports the goal of preventing problem gambling but believes that this particular measure will have negative consequences.</p>
<p>“I believe we need to do more to protect people from becoming addicted to gambling, but raising the minimum age is not the answer,” said Representative Iden. “It just pushes people into underground casinos and black markets, where there is no regulation and no protection from predatory behavior.”</p>
<p>Governor Whitmer has argued that this measure is necessary in light of research indicating that problem gambling rates are highest among those aged 18-21. Her office also points to other states that have raised the gaming age with positive results. In Massachusetts, for example, problem gambling rates among 18-21 year olds fell by more than 50% after the minimum age was raised to 21.</p>
<p>The new policy goes into effect on October 1st, 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-gaming-age-increased-to-21"><a href="#Michigan-gaming-age-increased-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Michigan gaming age increased to 21"></a>Michigan gaming age increased to 21</h1><p>Michigan gaming age increased to 21<br>As of Monday, October 15, 2018, the legal age for gaming in Michigan has been increased from 18 to 21. This change comes as a result of new legislation signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder in September.</p>
<p>Supporters of the increase say that it is necessary to better protect young people and prevent problem gambling. Critics argue that the change will simply push gaming activity underground and lead to more dangerous behavior.</p>
<p>The new law applies not only to casinos and other gambling establishments, but also to online games such as poker and casino apps. It is the first such increase in Michigan since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>So far there has been no indication of when or how the new age limit will be enforced. The Michigan Gaming Control Board says that it is up to individual businesses to decide whether to enforce the new limit themselves or wait for guidance from the state government.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-gaming-age-set-at-21-second-highest-in-the-country"><a href="#Michigan-gaming-age-set-at-21-second-highest-in-the-country" class="headerlink" title="Michigan gaming age set at 21, second highest in the country"></a>Michigan gaming age set at 21, second highest in the country</h1><p>Michigan gambling laws have been in the news a lot lately. This is because, on October 1st, 2018, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) set the minimum age at which one can gamble in the state at 21. This makes Michigan the second state in the US with a gambling age of 21, second only to California. However, there are some important caveats to this new law that residents of Michigan should be aware of.</p>
<p>First and foremost, although the minimum age for gambling has been increased to 21, this does not apply to all forms of gambling in Michigan. The minimum age for casino gaming remains at 18. So, if you are under 21 years old, you can still gamble at a casino in Michigan, just not in any other form of gambling.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that this new law does not apply to Native American tribes located in Michigan. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) allows Native American tribes to set their own minimum gambling ages, and most tribes in Michigan have chosen an age lower than 21. So, if you are under 21 years old and want to gamble, your best bet is likely to be a Native American casino.</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s worth mentioning that this change in the law applies only to land-based casinos. Online casinos are still allowed to accept players as young as 18 years old. So, if you’re under 21 and don’t live near a Native American casino, you can still gamble online.</p>
<p>So what prompted this change in Michigan’s gambling laws? The MGCB has stated that the increase in the minimum age was motivated by research which suggests that young people are more likely to develop problem gambling behaviours than adults are. They also argue that by setting the minimum age at 21, they will be able to better enforce responsible gaming measures and protect vulnerable populations such as college students.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with the MGCB’s reasoning, it’s clear that they aren’t going to be changing the minimum age anytime soon. So if you’re under 21 and want to gamble in Michigan, your best bet is to head to a Native American casino</p>
