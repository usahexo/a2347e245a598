The bill was passed on Thursday and it will provide tax relief to NJ taxpayers who win more than $5,000 at casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>Under the new law, the taxes on gambling winnings will be reduced from 35% to 20%. This is a significant savings for taxpayers, especially those who win big jackpots. The new law will also apply to lotteries and online gambling.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign the bill into law. Murphy has been a supporter of gambling expansion in NJ and he has stated that the tax relief will help “boost the state’s gaming industry.”</p>
<p>The reduction in taxes is good news for casino operators in NJ, many of which have been struggling in recent years. The tax relief will give players an incentive to gamble in NJ casinos and it should help operators attract more customers.</p>
<p>The bill was passed by the state Senate last month and it was approved by the Assembly on Thursday. It now goes to Governor Murphy for his signature.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-File-Your-NJ-Gambling-Winnings-taxes"><a href="#How-to-File-Your-NJ-Gambling-Winnings-taxes" class="headerlink" title="How to File Your NJ Gambling Winnings taxes"></a>How to File Your NJ Gambling Winnings taxes</h1><p>When you hit it big at the casino, you may be wondering how to report your gambling winnings on your New Jersey state income tax return. Here is a quick guide on how to file your NJ gambling winnings taxes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Report all of your gambling winnings on Line 7 of your NJ 1040 tax form.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you itemize deductions, you can also claim gambling losses on Line 28 of your Form 1040. However, you cannot claim more in losses than you Reported in winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling winnings are considered taxable income, and you will need to pay taxes on them just like any other type of income.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about filing your NJ gambling winnings taxes, please contact the IRS or visit their website.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Casino’s-pay-out-1-8B-in-winnings-tax-bill-follows"><a href="#NJ-Casino’s-pay-out-1-8B-in-winnings-tax-bill-follows" class="headerlink" title="NJ Casino’s pay out $1.8B in winnings, tax bill follows"></a>NJ Casino’s pay out $1.8B in winnings, tax bill follows</h1><p>The four largest casinos in New Jersey paid out $1.8B in winnings to their customers in 2017. This is a significant increase from the $1.3B that was paid out in 2016.</p>
<p>With this much money being won and paid out, it’s no surprise that the casinos are now facing a large tax bill. The state of New Jersey is expecting to collect $181M in taxes from the casinos this year.</p>
<p>This figure may seem high, but it is actually lower than what was originally expected. Earlier this year, lawmakers estimated that the casinos would owe $290M in taxes for 2017.</p>
<p>The lower tax bill is likely due to the fact that casino revenue has been declining in recent years. In addition, the casinos are now required to pay higher taxes on their profits.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the casinos remain a major contributor to the state’s economy. In 2017, they generated more than $2B in economic activity and employed nearly 17,000 people.</p>
<p>With so much money at stake, it’s no wonder that lawmakers are closely watching the casino industry. Recently, there have been calls for new casinos to be opened up in northern New Jersey.</p>
<p>If these proposals are approved, it could lead to even more tax revenue for the state government.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Winnings-Could-Cost-NJ-Residents-More-Than-Expected"><a href="#Gambling-Winnings-Could-Cost-NJ-Residents-More-Than-Expected" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Winnings Could Cost NJ Residents More Than Expected"></a>Gambling Winnings Could Cost NJ Residents More Than Expected</h1><p>The Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) in New Jersey released a report indicating that gambling winnings could cost the state more revenue than initially expected. The DGE report suggests that the Garden State will lose $1.3 billion in revenue over the next five years as a result of gambling winnings being exempted from income taxes.</p>
<p>The loss in revenue is the result of two recent federal court decisions that held that gambling winnings are not taxable income. The first decision was rendered in September 2014 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the case of US v. DiCristina. The second decision was rendered in November 2015 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the case of Comptroller of Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne. Both decisions were based on the argument that taxing gambling winnings would constitute a violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which protect citizens from double taxation.</p>
<p>New Jersey is not alone in its struggle to find a way to tax gambling winnings. A number of other states, including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Indiana, have also seen their efforts to tax gambling winnings thwarted by federal court decisions.</p>
<p>Governor Chris Christie has proposed a number of measures aimed at mitigating the impact of these decisions, including increasing taxes on other forms of income and expanding the state’s gambling offerings. However, these measures are likely to provide only limited relief, and New Jersey is expected to face a significant shortfall in revenue as a result of these court decisions.</p>
<h1 id="Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Tax on Gambling Winnings in New Jersey"></a>Tax on Gambling Winnings in New Jersey</h1><p>The New Jersey state government imposes a tax on gambling winnings earned by its residents. This tax is imposed at the rate of 10% of the amount won. The tax applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and horse race betting. </p>
<p>The rationale for imposing a tax on gambling winnings is to ensure that the winners pay their fair share of taxes. Gambling is considered a form of entertainment, and the state government wants its citizens to pay taxes on their winnings just like they would on any other form of income. </p>
<p>The New Jersey state government does not impose a tax on gambling losses incurred by its residents. This is because gambling losses are considered to be personal expenses, and are not subject to taxation. </p>
