One of the first instances of gambling in what is now the United States occurred in 1638 when the British founded the colony of New Hampshire. At that time, gambling was legal and considered a form of entertainment. The original version of what we now know as casino slots was also introduced during this time. Players would use actual metal coins to bet on games such as Faro, a precursor to blackjack.</p>
<p>As America grew, so did its interest in gambling. In 1820, the state of Louisiana became the first to offer commercial gambling opportunities in the form of riverboat casinos. Gambling continued to spread throughout the country, with states passing laws regulating and legalizing various forms of gambling. By 1931, there were several hundred casinos operating in America.</p>
<p>In 1933, Nevada became the first state to legalize casino gambling. This led to a gaming boom in Las Vegas and other parts of the state. Gambling was seen as a way to bring much-needed revenue to Nevada during the Great Depression. Other states followed suit and by 1978, every state except Utah had legalized some form of casino gambling.</p>
<p>While casino gambling is legal in most states, it is not without controversy. There are those who argue that casinos prey on people with addictive personalities and contribute to organized crime and other social ills. However, there are also those who argue that casinos provide much-needed jobs and revenue for local communities. The debate over whether or not casino gambling should be legalized is sure to continue into the future.</p>
