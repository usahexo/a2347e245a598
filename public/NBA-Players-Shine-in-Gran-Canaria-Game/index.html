        <h1 id="NBA-Players-Shine-in-Gran-Canaria-Game"><a href="#NBA-Players-Shine-in-Gran-Canaria-Game" class="headerlink" title="NBA Players Shine in Gran Canaria Game"></a>NBA Players Shine in Gran Canaria Game</h1><p>The Gran Canaria game is always a much-anticipated event on the NBA calendar, as it features some of the league’s brightest stars shining in an exhibition match. This year was no exception, with LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant all making appearances.</p>
<p>James started things off for the United States team by scoring the first nine points of the game. He was dominant down low and showed why he is considered one of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>Curry also had a strong performance, shooting 3-pointers with ease and demonstrating his trademark ball handling skills. He finished with 22 points, four rebounds, and four assists.</p>
<p>Durant was equally impressive, scoring 33 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. He was especially effective in the fourth quarter, when he led a comeback that nearly gave Team USA the victory.</p>
<p>In the end, however, Spain managed to prevail 102-96. Pau Gasol led all scorers with 34 points, while Marc Gasol chipped in with 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Spanish team looked very impressive against one of the best lineups in the NBA, and they will be one of the favorites to win gold at next year’s Olympics.</p>
<h1 id="Warriors-Breeze-Past-Heat-in-Gran-Canaria-Preseason-Clash"><a href="#Warriors-Breeze-Past-Heat-in-Gran-Canaria-Preseason-Clash" class="headerlink" title="Warriors Breeze Past Heat in Gran Canaria Preseason Clash"></a>Warriors Breeze Past Heat in Gran Canaria Preseason Clash</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors, reigning NBA champions, got their preseason campaign underway with a 116-96 victory over the Miami Heat in Gran Canaria on Sunday. Klay Thompson led the scoring for the Warriors with 19 points, while Kevin Durant and Draymond Green added 16 apiece.</p>
<p>Miami were led by 20 points from Wayne Ellington, with Goran Dragic adding 16 and Hassan Whiteside posting 15 points and 11 rebounds. The Heat trailed by just six points at halftime but were outscored 34-16 in the third quarter as the Warriors pulled away.</p>
<p>The game was played in front of a sellout crowd of 10,000 fans in the island’s Palmitos Park amphitheater, and both teams were clearly impressed with the experience. “It was an amazing atmosphere,” Durant said afterwards. “I think every player on our team enjoyed it.”</p>
<p>Sunday’s game was the first of two preseason contests for Golden State in Europe; they will also play against Minnesota in Paris on Friday. For Miami, it is just the start of a three-game European tour that also takes in games against Orlando and Washington in London.</p>
<h1 id="Lakers-Edge-Kings-at-Gran-Canaria-Exhibition-Match"><a href="#Lakers-Edge-Kings-at-Gran-Canaria-Exhibition-Match" class="headerlink" title="Lakers Edge Kings at Gran Canaria Exhibition Match"></a>Lakers Edge Kings at Gran Canaria Exhibition Match</h1><p>In their final warm-up game before the season opener, the Lakers edged out the Kings 106-103 at Gran Canaria. LeBron James led all scorers with 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting and recorded a double-double with 10 assists. JaVale McGee added 21 points on 9-of-10 shooting off the bench, and Kyle Kuzma had 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting.</p>
<p>Rookie Marvin Bagley III led the Kings with 24 points on 10-of-13 shooting, and second-year guard De’Aaron Fox had 19 points and six assists. Willie Cauley-Stein chipped in 16 points and nine rebounds.</p>
<p>The Lakers trailed by as many as eight points in the first half but rallied to take a 59-56 lead into halftime. They opened up a 12-point lead in the third quarter but allowed the Kings to get within two points late in the period. The Lakers then scored eight of the final 10 points of the game to seal the victory.</p>
<p>James was happy with how his team performed against a quality opponent. “We just kept battling,” he said afterward. “We got down, but we didn’t stop fighting. We did a good job of executing down the stretch … Against a good Kings team, we showed some good signs.”</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Stars-Shine-in-Gran-Canaria-Exhibition-Match"><a href="#NBA-Stars-Shine-in-Gran-Canaria-Exhibition-Match" class="headerlink" title="NBA Stars Shine in Gran Canaria Exhibition Match"></a>NBA Stars Shine in Gran Canaria Exhibition Match</h1><p>As the preseason kicks into gear, NBA stars get ready to battle it out on the court. On Saturday night, a star-studded exhibition match was held in Gran Canaria, Spain. In attendance were some of the biggest names in the NBA, including Lebron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.</p>
<p>The game started off with a bang, as Irving hit a three-pointer to give his team an early lead. However, the Spanish side rallied back and managed to take the lead going into halftime.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Americans came out firing. Led by James and Durant, they managed to pull away from their opponents and win comfortably 111-96. Durant led all scorers with 27 points, while James finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists.</p>
<p>It was a great display of basketball by some of the best players in the world. The game also showcased how competitive international basketball has become in recent years. With teams like Spain and France becoming increasingly strong, the NBA will have to continue to bring its best players if it wants to stay on top.</p>
<h1 id="Utah-Jazz-Defeat-Miami-Heat-at-NBA-Gran-Canaria-Game"><a href="#Utah-Jazz-Defeat-Miami-Heat-at-NBA-Gran-Canaria-Game" class="headerlink" title="Utah Jazz Defeat Miami Heat at NBA Gran Canaria Game"></a>Utah Jazz Defeat Miami Heat at NBA Gran Canaria Game</h1><p>The Utah Jazz overcame a Miami Heat team that was missing Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, and Hassan Whiteside on Saturday night with a 111-104 victory in the NBA Gran Canaria game.</p>
<p>Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points to lead the Utah Jazz (1-1), who had six players in double figures. Jae Crowder added 19 points while Rudy Gobert had 17 points and 12 rebounds.</p>
<p>Trey Burke came off the bench to score 16 points in 18 minutes for the Jazz.</p>
<p>“It was a good win. We were down three of our best players and I thought our young guys stepped up and played well,” Utah coach Quin Snyder said. “We were a little sloppy at times, but we got the win and that’s what matters.”</p>
<p>Josh Richardson led Miami with 24 points while Kelly Olynyk added 22 points. Tyler Johnson had 18 points for the Heat (1-2).</p>
<p>The Jazz led by as many as 14 points in the fourth quarter, but Miami rallied to make it a one-point game with less than two minutes left. But Utah made enough free throws down the stretch to seal the victory.</p>
