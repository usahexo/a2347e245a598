This is a momentous change for the small Balkan country and its citizens, who can now travel freely throughout the Schengen Zone.</p>
<p>The Schengen Zone is a grouping of 26 European countries that have abolished passport and other types of border control at their mutual borders. This allows for free movement of people between the countries within the zone. Prior to 2018, Albanians could only visit five Schengen Zone countries without a visa: Greece, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France.</p>
<p>The new visa-free travel arrangement for Albanians was made possible by the European Union’s Visa Liberalization Dialogue with Albania. This dialogue process began in late 2010 and aimed to assess Albania’s progress in meeting specific criteria related to border security, combatting organized crime and corruption, human rights, and asylum policy. After years of hard work by Albanian authorities, the dialogue process culminated in the granting of visa-free travel for Albanian nationals in 2018.</p>
<p>This development is a major win for Albania and its citizens. It opens up new opportunities for tourism, business travel, and studying abroad. It also helps to build closer ties between Albania and its European partners.</p>
<h1 id="Albania-hits-jackpot-with-600-million-oil-find"><a href="#Albania-hits-jackpot-with-600-million-oil-find" class="headerlink" title="Albania hits jackpot with $600 million oil find!"></a>Albania hits jackpot with $600 million oil find!</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The small Balkan country of Albania has hit the jackpot with a recent oil find. The discovery is said to contain up to 600 million barrels of crude oil, making it one of the largest in Europe. This windfall will come as a major boon to the country, which is still struggling to recover from a devastating financial crisis that struck in 1997.</p>
<h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Albania’s Prime Minister, Edi Rama, hailed the discovery as an “economic game changer”. He predicted that the oil would bring much needed jobs and investment to the country, and vowed to use the revenue wisely to improve public services and infrastructure.</p>
<h1 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The news of the oil find comes as a major relief for Albania, which has been searching for new sources of energy income since its main source, hydropower, was hit by a series of droughts in recent years. The government had been counting on the development of offshore oil and gas reserves to help revive its flagging economy.</p>
<h1 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>However, not everyone is celebrating the news of Albania’s big oil find. Some environmental campaigners have raised concerns about the potential impact on fragile ecosystems and wildlife habitats. They argue that proper safeguards must be put in place to prevent any damage from being done.</p>
<h1 id="Albania’s-beaches-named-among-world’s-best-by-TripAdvisor"><a href="#Albania’s-beaches-named-among-world’s-best-by-TripAdvisor" class="headerlink" title="Albania’s beaches named among world’s best by TripAdvisor!"></a>Albania’s beaches named among world’s best by TripAdvisor!</h1><p>After analyzing millions of user reviews, TripAdvisor has just released its list of the best beaches in the world and three Albanian beaches have made it to the top! In first place is Durres Beach, followed by Himara Beach and Saranda Beach in third place.</p>
<p>The list is based on the quality and quantity of reviews received by each beach over a 12-month period. So what makes Albanian beaches so special?</p>
<p>One factor is undoubtedly the stunningly clear turquoise water which makes for perfect swimming and snorkeling conditions. Add to that some beautiful white sand beaches and rugged mountain landscapes in the background, and you have yourself some amazing postcard-perfect scenery!</p>
<p>Locals are also welcoming and hospitable, eager to show visitors around their hometowns and make sure they have a great time. There’s certainly no shortage of things to do in Albania, from hiking and biking in the countryside to exploring ancient ruins or enjoying a night out on the town.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a beach vacation with a difference, why not consider Albania? You won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Albania-tops-list-of-cheapest-places-to-retire-in-Europe"><a href="#Albania-tops-list-of-cheapest-places-to-retire-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="Albania tops list of cheapest places to retire in Europe!"></a>Albania tops list of cheapest places to retire in Europe!</h1><p>Retiring in Europe can be expensive, with the cost of living often outweighing pension and social security payments. But all that may be about to change, as a new study has named Albania as the cheapest country in which to retire.</p>
<p>The research, carried out by international financial services company Natixis, looked at the cost of living for retirees in 43 European countries. It found that, despite a modest average income of €591 ($680) per month, Albania offers the best value for money when it comes to pensions, healthcare and everyday expenses.</p>
<p>So why is Albania such a good place for retirees? For starters, the country has a warm Mediterranean climate and relaxed lifestyle which is perfect for enjoying retirement. Healthcare is also very affordable, with basic treatments costing as little as €5 ($5.80). And when it comes to everyday expenses, groceries, restaurants and transportation are all relatively cheap when compared to other European countries.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some downsides to retiring in Albania. The country is still relatively underdeveloped, meaning that there are few luxury amenities and services available. Additionally, the language barrier can make life difficult for foreigners who don’t speak Albanian.</p>
<p>But overall, Albania offers retirees some of the best value for money in Europe. So if you’re looking for an affordable and relaxed place to spend your golden years, consider retiring in this charming Balkan country!</p>
