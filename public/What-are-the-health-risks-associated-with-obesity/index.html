Some of the most serious risks include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and arthritis.</p>
<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in America, and obesity is a major risk factor. People who are obese are at increased risk for developing high blood pressure, cholesterol problems, and heart disease. Heart disease is a condition in which the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart become narrowed and blocked. This can lead to a heart attack, in which the heart muscle is starved of oxygen and dies.</p>
<p>Stroke is another serious health risk associated with obesity. A stroke occurs when a vessel that carries blood to the brain becomes blocked or ruptures. This can cause damage to the brain cells, leading to paralysis or death.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that can lead to blindness, amputations, and early death if not treated. Diabetes occurs when the body cannot use insulin properly to convert sugar into energy. People who are obese are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Cancer is a leading cause of death in America, and obesity is a major risk factor for many types of cancer. Some cancers that are more common among people who are obese include breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Arthritis is a common condition that affects millions of Americans. Arthritis is characterized by joint pain and inflammation. Obesity increases the risk for developing arthritis because it puts stress on joints.</p>

Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death.

<p>Start by making simple changes to your daily routine. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, park further away from the store entrance, or get up and move around every hour or so if you’re working at a computer.</p>
<p>In addition, make sure to include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet, as well as whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats. Try to avoid processed foods and sugary drinks. And remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day.</p>
